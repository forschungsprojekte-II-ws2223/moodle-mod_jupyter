# Jupyter Moodle plugin

This Moodle plugin integrates Jupyter Notebooks to offer a virtual programming environment.

This plugin connects to a JupyterHub server and authenticates the Moodle users on the JupyterHub Server. That way they
can access a Jupyter notebook from within Moodle. Further development includes the options to submit solved
notebooks and to distribute notebooks by the teacher to the students.
